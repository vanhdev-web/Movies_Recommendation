# Movies Recommendation System üé¨

## Description

I've just finised a movie recommendation system built using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and Streamlit. The system suggests top movies related to a user's favorite movie based on genre similarity. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to provide recommendations.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Movie Title Input:** Users can select a movie title from a dropdown list powered by the `movies.csv` file.
*   **Genre-Based Recommendation:** The system recommends movies with similar genres to the selected movie.
*   **Similarity Calculation:** Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer and cosine similarity to determine the similarity between movies based on their genres.
*   **Streamlit Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface using the Streamlit library.
*   **"Xem th√™m" button:** Loads 10 more movies each time it's clicked, up to a maximum of 30 additional recommendations.

## Technology Stack

*   Python 3.x
*   Streamlit
*   Pandas
*   Scikit-learn (sklearn)
*   ydata-profiling (optional, for generating the HTML report)

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   Pip package installer

## Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vanhdev-web/Movies_Recommendation
    cd Movies_Recommendation
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn ydata-profiling
    ```

    Note: `ydata-profiling` is optional and only needed to generate the HTML report. You can omit it if you only want to run the recommendation system.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Select a movie:**
    Use the dropdown menu to select a movie title.

4.  **View recommendations:**
    The system will display a table of top movies similar to the selected movie.
5.  **Load More Recommendations**
    Click on "Xem th√™m" button to load 10 more recommendations (max 3 clicks).

## File Structure and Explanation

*   `app.py`: Contains the Streamlit application code for the user interface and recommendation display.
*   `movies_recommendation.py`: Contains the movie recommendation logic, including data loading, feature extraction, and similarity calculation.
*   `movies.csv`: Dataset of movies, tab-separated, with columns for `movie_id`, `title`, and `genres`. Example:

    ```
    1	Toy Story (1995)	Animation|Children's|Comedy
    2	Jumanji (1995)	Adventure|Children's|Fantasy
    ```
*   `movies_recommendation_report.html`: (Optional) HTML report generated by `ydata-profiling` for data exploration.
